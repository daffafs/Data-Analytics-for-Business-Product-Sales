# Project Problem
The sales department of a company that sells electronic goods has one year sales information. They want to do an analysis of the data to obtain information as a supporting material for decision making in their business. Because now the assumption is the end of the year. The company wants to provide a strategy to increase sales and customers. However, the company does not yet have a special strategy in the future. As data analyst, we are needed to process sales data in order to provide knowledge to the sales department and help answer the questions raised by them including:
1. What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
2. What city had the highest number of sales?
3. How Are Sales Trends in The Top 5 Cities?
4. What time should we display adversedisement to maximize the likelihood of customer's buying product?
5. What products are most often sold together?
6. What Product Sold the Most? Why do you think it sold the most?

# Project Goals
The purpose of this project is to answer the questions that have been described in business problems. In this project we will:
1. Import data and combine it in one dataframe
2. Data Profile: Search for information about data shape, data type, data characteristics, missing value data, unique data values, and find data duplication.
3. Data Cleansing: Handling missing value, deleting duplicate data, changing data types, and changing data formats.
4. Exploring data using data manipulation and data visualization

This project consists of three parts:
1. Prepare Data
    - Data import
    - Data Profiling
    - DataCleansing
2. Explore (Analyzing Data)
3. Conclusion

# Data Description
1. Order ID - An Order ID is the number system that Amazon uses exclusively to keep track of orders. Each order receives its own Order ID that will not be duplicated. This number can be useful to the seller when attempting to find out certain details about an order such as shipment date or status.
2. Product - The product that have been sold.
3. Quantity Ordered - Ordered Quantity is the total item quantity ordered in the initial order (without any changes).
4. Price Each - The price of each products.
5. Order Date - This is the date the customer is requesting the order be shipped.
6. Purchase Address - The purchase order is prepared by the buyer, often through a purchasing department. The purchase order, or PO, usually includes a PO number, which is useful in matching shipments with purchases; a shipping date; billing address; shipping address; and the request items, quantities and price.
